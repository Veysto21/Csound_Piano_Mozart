# Veysto21-Csound_Piano_Mozart
Overview:
In this musical exploration, I've crafted a short piece reminiscent of Mozart's style. 
The Csound script provided in this repository defines instrument parameters, pitch sequences, and durations to emulate the classical feel. 
While it may not match the complexity of Mozart's compositions, this project serves as an exciting venture into translating classical nuances into a digital audio format.

Features:
Instrument Definition: Utilizes a modified pluck instrument to create a piano-like sound.
Score Events: Represents a Mozart-inspired melody with varying pitches, durations, and amplitudes.
CsoundQt Integration: Developed using the CsoundQt IDE for an interactive and visual composition experience.

How to Explore:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Csound script in the CsoundQt IDE.
Experiment with the melody by modifying the score events or adjusting instrument parameters.
Play the composition to experience the Mozart-inspired soundscape.
Feel free to explore, experiment, and share your own variations of classical compositions using Csound. 
If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or reach out. Enjoy the artistic journey with Mozart's influence and modern digital synthesis!
